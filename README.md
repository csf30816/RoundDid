# RoundDid
Rounded is a font made by Elijah Porter (me). It is a nice smooth font that combines thinness with roundness, balancing the two of those perfectly. The result of the combining of thinness and roundness is RoundDid, this font is perfect for headers, sub-headers, and — beleive it or not — code editors.
